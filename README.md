# HusCompagnietAppProject

To minimize building material waste, we want to create an application for Android, where people - within businesses as well as private - can sell or give away excessive building material from projects.
There is a massive amount of wasted building material on a yearly basis. With this app, it is possible to reuse building materials other people or businesses no longer need. 

The app is made to promote reusing and make people reuse leftover building material. It can benefit both a selling part as well as the buying part:
- Selling part does not have to use recourses to get rid of their leftover materials
- Buying part can recieve usable material for cheap or complete free

***USER STORIES:***

-	"As a buyer, I want to easily find currently available building materials, as well as sort through different types of available material to find exactly what I need."
-	"When I find a seller, I want to be able to quickly purchase a part or all of the material for sale"
-	"I want to be able to see the location of the materials to avoid traveling too far to pick it up."

-	"As a seller, I want to quickly and easily enlist building materials for sale or for free to minimize the trouble of getting rid of them."
-	"I want to receive potential payment through the app to avoid being cheated."
