# HusCompagnietAppProject

To minimize building material waste, we want to create an application for Android, where people - within businesses as well as private - can sell or give away excessive building material from projects.
There is a massive amount of wasted building material on a yearly basis. With this app, it is possible to reuse building materials other people or businesses no longer need. 
The app is made to promote reusing and make people reuse leftover building material. It can benefit both a selling part as well as the buying part:
- Selling part does not have to use recourses to get rid of their leftover materials
- Buying part can recieve usable material for cheap or complete free
